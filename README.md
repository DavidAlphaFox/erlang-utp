==========

uTP implementation in Erlang

## State

This implementation is around 80% done. Specifically it lacks support for SACKs and support for Nagles algorithm. In addition the code has seen very little testing on a large scale. The tests it survives are mostly "in laboratory" tests. Before you use this for real, it might be advisable to test the code and report any bugs you find.

## TODO

See the file TODO.org

It contains a haphazard list of items that needs to be done, as well as everything done on the project.

Also see the file utp.todo.md which is an older todo-list of things that needs to be done. I am afraid that both are rather hard to read for the uninitiated. Sorry.
